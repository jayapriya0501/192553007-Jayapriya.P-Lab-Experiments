# Lab Assignment 4 - Data Analytics with Python & Pandas

This repository contains 4 lab programs demonstrating various data analytics concepts using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## 📋 Overview

- **Program 1**: Basic Data Exploration
- **Program 2**: Four Types of Data Analytics (Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive)
- **Program 3**: Data Visualization (Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Histogram)
- **Program 4**: Root Cause Analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
uv add pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
```

### 2. Generate Synthetic Datasets

```bash
uv run generate_datasets.py
```

This will create 4 CSV files:
- `employees_data.csv` - Employee records
- `sales_data.csv` - Sales transactions
- `products_data.csv` - Product information
- `monthly_performance.csv` - Monthly business metrics

### 3. Run Individual Programs

```bash
# Program 1: Basic Data Exploration
uv run program1_data_exploration.py

# Program 2: Four Types of Analytics
uv run program2_analytics_types.py

# Program 3: Data Visualization
uv run program3_visualizations.py

# Program 4: Root Cause Analysis
uv run program4_root_cause_analysis.py
```
